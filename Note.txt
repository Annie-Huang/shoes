C:\react\shoes>npm init -y
C:\react\shoes>npm install -g node-sass

C:\react\shoes>npm run sass     << Decide not to use node-sass transpile before it doesn't support transpile @supports.
                                   Where as filewatcher does transpile correct, change back to use file-watcher.

                                   Plus file watcher generates main.css.map as well.


Note:
node-sass doesn't not support @supports.
